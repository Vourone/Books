# This code is a Python program that accomplishes a simple task. It is traditionally a beginner's first program. The box below shows what happens when you execute the program. The terminal application gives a command prompt (% in this book) and executes the commands that you type (in boldface in this book). The result of executing python with this code is that the program writes Hello, World in the terminal window (the fourth line).

import stdio

# Write 'Hello World' to standard input.
stdio.writeln('Hello, World')
